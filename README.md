## New to GIT?
As I've mentioned before, if any of the terms are unknown to you or seem a bit vague, it's important to communicate with the team or me about Git. Git is not hard to understand and use, but it's also easy to make small mistakes that can lead to bigger problems and cost a lot of time. 
Communication is key, even if you already know a lot about Git. Asking questions is a way to prevent problems from building up in the long run.

## General information
- The project is build in Visual studio.
- The program can be run on both VsCode and Visual Studio.
- Pushing, Pulling, Fetching, etc can be done on both VsCode and Visual Studio.
